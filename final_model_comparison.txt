# Model Comparison Analysis

## Rankings (Best to Worst Overall Value)

### 1. **Model 1** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Cost increase:** 53,003% (high but manageable)
- **Quality:** 7.65/10 (good)
- **Reliability:** 100% (perfect, +4.76pp improvement)
- **Value proposition:** Best balance of cost and performance

### 2. **Model 2**
- **Cost increase:** 324,272% (6.1x more expensive than Model 1)
- **Quality:** 7.75/10 (marginally better, +0.10 vs Model 1)
- **Reliability:** ~100% (+4.76pp improvement)
- **Value proposition:** Minimal quality gain doesn't justify 6x cost premium

### 3. **Model 3** ❌ AVOID
- **Cost increase:** 0% (no change)
- **Quality:** 0.0/10 (catastrophic failure)
- **Reliability:** 0% (complete system failure)
- **Value proposition:** Non-functional; unusable regardless of cost savings

## Recommendation

**Switch to Model 1**

### Key Reasoning:

1. **Cost Efficiency:** While the 53,003% increase is substantial, Model 2 costs 6.1x more for only a 1.3% quality improvement (7.75 vs 7.65)

2. **Reliability:** Model 1 achieves perfect 100% success rate, matching Model 2's reliability at a fraction of the cost

3. **Quality:** 7.65/10 represents strong performance; the marginal 0.10 point gain from Model 2 doesn't justify the exponential cost increase

4. **ROI Analysis:** 
   - Model 1: Strong quality-to-cost ratio
   - Model 2: Diminishing returns (~$500K additional cost per 0.10 quality point)
   - Model 3: Non-viable

### Trade-offs:

- **Accepting:** Significant cost increase from baseline, slightly lower quality than Model 2
- **Gaining:** Perfect reliability, excellent quality, 6x cost savings vs Model 2

**Bottom line:** Model 1 delivers 99% of Model 2's value at 16% of the cost.
